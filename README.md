Tapas2Go - Tapas as a Service!
================================

Tapas2Go is a web application built with the aim to showcase the
[Sping Integration](http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration) framework. It can be considered as a new rendition of
the [Widgets & Gadgets â€˜R Us (WGRUS)](http://www.eaipatterns.com/Chapter1.html) example described on the
["Enterprise Integration Patterns"](http://www.eaipatterns.com/eaipatterns.html) and a homage to
[the traditional Spanish Bar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6syFNP5pUHE).
